In Karrestraat find many different shops, but also some sights. On the left you see a red gate. On the stone gate his sheep heads and see the weapon of Breda. Behind the doors of the gate is an alley leading to the back of the Grand Place. Earlier this gate served as the deterioration of the meat market which was located on the Grand Place. The gate was made in 1614 by stonemason Melchior of Herbach. Until 1995 the Breda Museum confirmed at this property.
