Willem Merkx Garden in Breda is an 'oasis' of art and peace in the city. Nowhere do you see in Breda so much art in a small area as here. There are 14 artifacts to find and a sundial (which we can not really classify as art). The Merkx Garden is more or less hidden behind the former primary mansions in Catherine Street, St. Anne Street and the Veemarktstraat and is accessible through three gates. One of the ports on the side of Catherine Street sign is installed with the words "Court of Ghestel". The garden is bordered in fact and even extends into the backyards of the local residents. Because of the semi-public character and out of respect for the privacy of the residents, the garden is only open to the public between 8:00 and 16:00 and on weekends between 11:00 and 17:00. The garden is a unique piece of culture with beautiful trees and plants. The Merkx Garden is named after William Merkx who was mayor from 1967 to 1983.
