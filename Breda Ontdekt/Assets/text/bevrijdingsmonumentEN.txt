The monument "Judith with the Head of Holofernes' in Breda is a white stone statue of a standing female figure with a human head in her left hand and a sword in her right hand. The image is placed on a round column of white stone. Under the column is a square embossed, where men with guns and women with children depicted. The column is placed on a pedestal, on which texts by the poet Karel Meeuwesse shine. In addition to the image is a small memorial stone.

Symbolism:
The performance is inspired by the biblical figure Judith (from the apocryphal book), defeating the enemy by herself. This evil is overcome.
