Description:
What portrays the picture exactly is a question for many Egyptians Breda. Is it just a rusty image? Is it perhaps a bull? The 7.5-meter-high work of art is the work of Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman. The rust-colored sculpture represents the 'Binding of Isaac' for. The picture shows a Bible story again where Abraham is instructed to sacrifice his son Isaac. At the last moment holds an angel to Abraham. He sacrifices instead of his own son, in the bushes entangled ram.
