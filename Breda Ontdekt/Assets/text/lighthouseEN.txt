Description: Many designs of Aldo Rossi (1931-1997) embark on the borderline between art and architecture. Perhaps his work can be characterized as the best visual architecture. The artwork in Breda is a spatial, architectural model and clearly recognizable as a lighthouse. The oktagonale 18 meter high work not only functions as a lighthouse, it is not accessible and is in the urban environment in an alien place.

Aldo Rossi was one of the postmodern architects who from the Sixties turned against what they considered dogmatic rationality and functionality of the Modern Movement. Rossi became famous with his book appeared in 1966 'L'architettura della città' and with projects such as "Teatro del Mondo 'for the Venice Biennale in 1979. The postmodern architects felt that architecture was more than function. They were referring to their designs to archetypes and historical examples, used the symbolic value of colors and shapes and locks a means to reach an expressive function of an object. And while architectural designs by definition start from a function, they were shocked not to return to develop projects that served no purpose other than to evoke memories, associations to release job, or to stimulate the imagination: architecture as sculpture.
